#+TITLE: System Configuration

* Applications

I'm terrible at keeping track of the actual programs I need for my
setup, but here's a stab at it.

#+TBLNAME: programs

| procmail     |
| emacs        |

  pacman -S $programs
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:

* Versioning of Config

Config can be installed using Gnu Stow. Clone this repo into a home
directory.

Each directory is a Stow repo. The contents can be installed with, for
example

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  stow emacs
#+END_SRC

This will symlink the contents of the emacs folder into the parent
directory of the repo (this should be the home directory).

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  cd ~/dotfiles
  stow emacs
  stow auto
  stow bash
  stow i3
  stow x
#+END_SRC

* Starting systemd services

There are various Systemd unit files in ~/auto, for tasks from
fetching emails to syncing git repositories. They can be installed
with

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
systemctl --user enable $serviceFile
systemctl --user start $service
systemctl --user enable $timerFile
#+END_SRC

* Email

Email is being downloaded with a combination of getmail and
procmail. Email server configs are stored in .getmail/. For the backed
up version, these are encrypted, and will need to be decrypted
beforehand.

Procmail applies any email rules. It's rules need to be placed in ~/.procmailrc.

auto/getmail.service and auto/getmail.timer trigger this at regular
intervals.

Antivirus on emails is done by ClamAV. It's virus definitions are kept
up to date by the system service freshclamd.service.

Emacs uses .authinfo.gpg for its email sending config. It's
interactive, so it can ask to decrypt the config only when you want to
send a mail.

Mail can be read by any reader that supports the maildir standard. For
example, Mutt, Emacs, or GNOME Evolution. Searching can be achieved by
using these programs' search functions, or since it's just plaintext
using something like grep.

Backups (scripted in ~/auto) are run regularly using git bundles, and
stored on Cloudfiles.
